//! Tiny crate for simple configuration management.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! This crate handles:
//!
//! - Retrieval of values of configuration properties from multiple sources, such as environment variables or files
//! - Parsing of retrieved data
//! - Displaying human-readable errors if case a step does not succeed
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Each configurable property of the dependent binary must have an arbitrary *key*, a name used to define its value, usually in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
//!
//! For example, some keys may be:
//!
//! - `TELEGRAM_API_KEY`
//! - `OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`
//! - `SCREEN_RESOLUTION`
//!
//! ## High-level API
//!
//! The recommended usage of this crate is via the high-level API, which comprises the [`required`] and [`optional`] functions.
//!
//! They automatically try to retrieve a value from the following sources, in this order, returning as soon as one is found:
//!
//! 1. the contents of the environment variable `{key}`;
//! 2. the contents of the file located at path specified in the environment variable `{key}_FILE`.
//!
//! If no value is found, or if an error occurred while trying to retrieve it, the function panics with a human-readable error message.
//!
//! Additionally, they try to parse the value into the requested Rust type using its [`std::str::FromStr`] trait.
//!
//! If the conversion fails, the function panics, again providing a human-readable error message.
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! To require a `IP_ADDRESS` property to be configured, and to parse it as an [`std::net::IpAddr`], you may write the following code:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::net::IpAddr;
//!
//! # std::env::set_var("IP_ADDRESS", "192.168.1.1");
//! let ip_addr: IpAddr = micronfig::required("IP_ADDRESS");
//! ```
//!
//! To allow the user to not specify it, and provide a default, you may write:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::net::{IpAddr, Ipv4Addr};
//!
//! # std::env::remove_var("IP_ADDRESS");
//! let ip_addr: IpAddr = micronfig::optional("IP_ADDRESS").unwrap_or(IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::LOCALHOST));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Middle-level API
//!
//! If you want more control on how errors are handled or on how the key is manipulated to access values, you can use the middle-level API, comprised of the [`any::get`] function and the [`any::Source`] enum.
//!
//! [`any::get`] works similarly to the [`required`] and [`optional`] functions, but returns a [`any::Source`] enum variant instead, which denotes the source a result was obtained from, and contains the raw [`Result`] of the operation.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! To customize the handling of the same `IP_ADDRESS` as earlier, so that something is printed instead of the binary panicking, you may write the following code:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::net::IpAddr;
//! use micronfig::any::{get, Source};
//!
//! let ip_addr: Source<IpAddr> = get("IP_ADDRESS", "_FILE");
//!
//! match ip_addr {
//!     Source::Var(Ok(addr)) | Source::File(Ok(addr)) => println!("Success! Â· {}", &addr),
//!     _ => println!("Failure..."),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Low-level API
//!
//! Finally, if you want to override the accessed sources, you may use the low level API directly, comprised of the following modules:
//!
//! - [`var`] for accessing environment variable
//! - [`file`] for accessing files with the path defined in environment variables
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! To retrieve the `IP_ADDRESS` only from the environment variable, and ignoring other sources:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::net::IpAddr;
//! use micronfig::var::get;
//!
//! # std::env::set_var("IP_ADDRESS", "192.168.1.1");
//! let ip_addr: IpAddr = get("IP_ADDRESS").expect("IP_ADDRESS envvar to be defined");
//! ```
//!
//! # More examples
//!
//! Other examples are provided in the crate source, [inside the `examples/` directory](https://github.com/Steffo99/micronfig/tree/main/examples).
